Change the font of this to Fixedsys BOLD pt 20. This is the font I want the game to have

I have no idea how to work the Final Boss into the game yet, so it's weird and bad right now : try to ignore any mentions of the "King Slime" for now
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Titles:
*Slime Quest
*Slime Hunt
*Slime Safari
*Soul Snatcher
*Scalene and the Slime Safari

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gameplay : (Heavily inspired by Cave Story since it has a gun with similar projectile physics and gameplay in general : think of the Polestar from cavestory for how I invision the gun gameplay to be like)

CONTROLS : (there should be both keyboard and controller support. Keys MAY NOT be rebound through the OPTIONS in the final game)

How the player will control (keyboard)
-My vision of the controls align a lot with how cave story handles their controls
*arrow keys (right and left) : for movement right and left
*arrow key (up) : the player will look up and aim their gun directly up : MAYBE also move camera up (maybe not though, we'll see how well it fits)
*arrow key (down) : the player will duck and their gun will aim lower horizontally
*Z : jumping and confirming
*X : shooting and cancel
*ESC : PAUSE menu
*Q : COLLECTION menu

How the player will control (controller)
*control stick (X Axis + and -) : for movement right and left
*control stick (Y Axis +) : the player will look up and aim their gun directly up : MAYBE also move camera up (maybe not though, we'll see how well it fits)
*control stick (Y Axis -) : the player will duck and their gun will aim lower horizontally
*button 0 (or "A" on Xbox controller) : jumping and confirming
*button 2 and button 1 ("X" and "B" on Xbox controller) : shooting and cancel
*Button 8 ("START" on Xbox Controller) : PAUSE menu
*Button 9 and Button 3 ("BACK" and "Y" on Xbox controller) : COLLECTION menu


System : MENUS

*PAUSE MENU
-accessed by the buttons listed above
-has the options for : 
-COLLECTION : lists all SLIME SOULS found and how much you have : lists current money : Possibly have a counter of how many slimes are left in the specific "room" you are in
-OPTIONS : brings up a list of options which are : Fullscreen / Windowed : Sound sliders (volume and sound fx)
-QUIT : brings up a promt that says "are you sure? Yes / No" : if you press "Yes" the game closes itself : if you press "No" the promt closes and you are on the normal PAUSE MENU 

*SHOP MENU
-accessed by pressing the confirm button in front of the SHOP
-brings up a window with the shop keeper(Lotte)'s portrait and some options
-has the options for : 
-BUY : brings up a prompt which lists various upgrades and prices
-SELL : brings up a prompt which lists your COLLECTION : has the heart on the left, and the price for each on the right (better shown visually)
~TALK(might be scrapped in favor for dialougue playing after certain ammounts of slimes have been sold, and directly after the sale) : would play dialougue : dialougue played is dependant on how many SLIME SOULS the player has sold
-SAVE : saves current progress (see System : SAVING below)
-FINAL : hidden option that is only revealed to the player after they have sold 100(number subject to change) SLIME SOULS : plays a cutscene (undecided right now) where Scalene is somehow teleported to a room that is right next to the room you fight the King Slime in (this is bad right now, because I intend to expand upon this later)
-LEAVE : closes shop menu

System : SAVING

*This data will be saved : 
-SLIME SOULS collected : Which slimes are alive / dead : What slime souls + how many the player has : money : upgrades purchased : HP : How many SLIME SOULS the player has sold (in general, not by type) : If Lotte's house is locked : If the "FINAL" SHOP MENU option is unlocked
*Saving will be done by talking to the shop keeper (Lotte) and choosing the SAVE option


System : GAMEPLAY :

*Player (Scalene)

*Actions : (keybinds listed under CONTROLS)
-moving (right and left) : a walking animation will play, and be flipped depending on the direction pushed : footsteps will play depending on which frame the animation is in (after each "step")
-looking up : will point gun upward and MAYBE move camera up : you may not shoot upwards while jumping
-ducking : player crouches and gun is lowered : a crouching animation will be played and the gun will be physically lower : hitbox on Y Axis is shorter
-jumping : player moves upward and falls back down : jump height can be controlled by how long the jump button is pressed : will not jump a second time unless the button is released and pressed again : will play a jumping animation and a (quiet) sound effect : when the player lands, a small smoke cloud instance appears and disappears and a landing sound effect is played
-shooting : player creates and instance of a bullet that moves forward and destroys itself after it's animation has played fully : this bullet does a set ammount of damage to slimes it hits once per bullet : bullet it shot depending in a certain direction depending on the state / positioning of the player (neutral = R or L from middle of player, crouching = R or L from lower part of player, looking up = upwards from middle of player) 

*Planned interactions with environment
-walking into walls stops the walking animation and the player
-pressing the confirm button in front of the shop keeper brings up the SHOP MENU
-jumping on top of slimes makes you bounce off and sound effect plays : some slimes react when hopped on by playing an animation
-touching a slime fron any side except for the top takes away some HP and plays a sound effect

*ENEMIES :
-all slimes are toxic to Scalene, therefore if they touch her she loses HP
-the players bullet does 1(+upgrades) damage to all slimes per bullet 
-each slime disappears from the world forever when killed

*Sleepy Slime : GREEN
-wants to sleep
-it's hitbox is shorter than other slimes and requires the player the crouch and shoot

*Sheepy Slime : LIGHTBLUE
-wants to be alone...
-moves around randomly, and if the player gets within a certain radius of it - it hops away

*Kissy Slime : YELLOW
-wants to poke the player
-moves around randomly, and if the player gets within a certain radius of it - it hops toward the player

*Spooky Slime : PURPLE
-wants to bite the player
-moves around randomly, and if the player gets within a certain (largish) radius - it hops quickly toward the player

*Flappy Slime : PINK
-wants to fly
-moves in a set pattern in the air

*Slinky Slime : DARK BLUE
-wants to spit at the player
-moves back and forth until the player is within a certain radius
~when the player is in the radius the slime shoots a lobbed projectile at the player either right or left depending on where the player is : like a hammer bro from super mario

*King Slime : ROYAL
-Final Boss
-You can only fight him after you have sold every single other SLIME SOUL in the game
-will decide what the fight will be like at a later date


*SLIME SOULS : (dropped by slimes upon death)
-effected by gravity : falls to ground when spawned until it hits the floor
-different sell values depending on type MAYBE
-can be traded for money
*GREEN
*LIGHTBLUE
*YELLOW
*PURPLE
*PINK
*DARKBLUE
*ROYAL

Story:

Main Area :
*A small barn-like house : if the player presses the confirm button in front of this little house it brings up a dialogue box that says "Locked"
-the house gets unlocked later in the game - if the player chooses a certain dialougue option shown below at "80 souls sold"
*A Shop with the shop keeper(Lotte) at the counter of the shop

Characters :

*Scalene
-short and fat lizard
-no outstanding personality : silent protagonist
-no dialougue except for possible text promts and implied reactions
-is exploring this slime world just for fun

*Lotte
-short unicorn who runs the upgrade shop
-possible personality : seems introverted but opens up as the game goes on : similar to Sable from Animal Crossing
-inventor / mechanic : she invents what the player's upgrades are : creates mechanical things for fun
-she buys SLIME SOULS to power a mechanical horse robot she is making : this info will be revealed late into the game
-she stands on a stool behind the counter of the shop because she is short


Slimes: 
There could possibly be a slime encyclopedia, and some of the descriptions in here can be placed into it

*Sleepy Slime
-likes to sleep
-never wakes up until it dies : opens it eyes upon death

*Sheepy Slime
-shy
-cries upon death

*Kissy Slime
-infatuated with the Scalene
-opens eyes and flower falls off upon death

*Spooky Slime
-anger issues
-wants nothing more than to bite someone... and that person is - you!

*Flappy Slime
-no personality
-no eyes
-just flies

*Slinky Slime
-wants to show affection for it's new friend Scalene by spitting at her
-they are not aware this strange tradition actually hurts non-slimes

*King Slime
-calm, and professional
-wants nothing more than to lead it's kind into a better tomorrow...  what's left of them.



*SHOP DIALOGUE : (after a certain ammount are sold)
-Dialogue will only be shown after a certain SLIME SOUL milestone is reached after selling : if it isn't reached no dialogue will play at all after selling
-Numbers of souls required to see certain dialogue are subject to change

*First time walking past shop (no TALK needed) : forced dialougue box appears : shop menu opens
-(Scalene summons a "!" above her head and turns to face the shop owner : shop menu is forced open)
-Woah - I'm not used to visitors
-My name is Lotte, welcome to my shop!
-If you find something you like, please feel free to buy it.
-...Hmm. Seems like your short on funds.
-...
-... (I have an idea!)
-Do you want to do me a favor? I'll pay you
-PROMPT : "Yes / Bye"
"Bye" : -.... : shop menu closes
"Yes" : -I think that weird gun your holding can help out both of us.
-If you see a SLIME, you could probably fight it with that gun and get their SLIME SOUL
-I'll pay you for any SLIME SOULs you bring to this shop
-...
-...(they sure don't talk much do they.)
-Um. Goodbye : shop window closes

*0 souls sold and player presses the confirm button in front of the shop
-How's your slime hunting going?
-...
-Hmm. I see

*1 soul sold
-Thanks for the SLIME SOUL
-It'll help a lot.
-It'll help even more if you sell me another.
-...

*2 souls sold
-You sure did find a couple slimes
-Literally
-A couple.
-...

*5 souls sold
-Woah
-If you keep this up, I might go bankrupt- haha

*20 souls sold
-Goodjob on the slimes so far, I'll give you a tip
-You probabaly noticed already, but there's a finite ammount of slimes
-Make sure you're thorough, or else cleaning up the rest might get a bit tricky

*30 souls sold
-You sure are good at kill-
-...
-uh. Slime. Hunting...?

*40 souls sold
-Sorry if it seemed a bit weird earlier with the whole "kill" thing.
-Slimes are technically not "living", so you can't really "kill" them.
-I think.

*60 souls sold
-It sure is a lot quieter around here.
-... 
-Goodluck with your slime hunting.

*80 souls sold [mini cutscene]
-We've known eachother for quite a while now
-You seem pretty trustworthy, so
-Do you want to know what I've been using these SLIME SOULs for?
-PROMPT "I'm curious / Don't care, never will"
-"Don't care, never will" : -.... : closes dialogue box, but not shop
-"I'm curious" : -I almost thought you'd say no. Hold on a minute- : the shop window closes and she steps down from the stool she's on and only the top of her head is visible
-She walks out the side of the building (through a door) and walks over to her house which is next to the shop
-Peek your head through the door : Scalene walks over (scripted) : Screen fades out and fades back in with a picture of whats inside Lotte's house
-when the player pressed the confirm button again it fades back to the outside of the house with both Scalene and Lotte outside again : Lotte runs back inside the shop and stands back up on her stool
-the player can move again : you now have access to viewing the inside of Lotte's house any time you want

*99 souls sold
-You've been working very hard.
-If you don't mind me asking, why did you come here in the first place?
-PROMPT "Because I was bored / Well, it sure wasn't to talk to you."
-"Well, it sure wasn't to talk to you." : -.... : dialogue box closes but not the shop menu
-"Because I was bored" : -Really?
-I was expecting something more complex, but
-I hope my "favor" helped with your boredom a bit.
-Speaking of that favor
-I've been keeping track of the places you have gone and it seems like you found almost every SLIME SOUL
-If I'm correct you only have one left for me to buy
-We might have to say goodbye soon...

*100 souls sold (NOTE TO SELF : REWRITE THIS IT'S BAD)
-You did it
-You found every single SLIME SOUL on this entire planet-
-Well - almost every single one
-The only one left is the SLIME SOUL of "King Slime"
-If you're ready to fight him, and take his SLIME SOUL just let me know : the dialogue box closes and the option for "FINAL" appears on the SHOP MENU

*101 souls sold
-!!
-fuck I'll write this later, I ran out of creative energy like an hour ago

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Details With the Design:

DIALOGUE
*IMPORTANT : The font for all dialogue text should be Fixedsys BOLD (pt of 20 possibly)
*Dialogue text should be played in a type writer format : a sound effect is played for each character displayed, and each character is displayed one letter at a time very quickly : like in most RPG's
