0.0.8 (November 11, 2017)
------------------------------
Player variables are now loaded externally via a JSON file (useful for altering variables w/o recompiling)
Controller support added (but still might be a bit buggy since i haven't tested it)
Renamed "PlayState" to "PrototypeLvl"
Renamed "level.tmx" to "prototypeLvl.tmx"
Global keys (keyboard commands that aren't specific to only a specific game screen) can now be added
Added global key "F" to toggle in-game fullscreen
All level classes extend "BaseLevel" instead of "FlxState" for easier more global functions shared between levels (Like adding enemies to the level)
Working on a more dynamic way of loading TiledEditor maps:
 - TileMap properties can be set externally (Good for multiple levels, but still a WIP)
 - Streamable Sprites (WIP)
 // Info: Streamable Sprites are sprites that can be dynamically created and destroyed as the camera pans, useful for useful for lightening the CPU and MEM usage (If you have hundreds of sprites in a map, they will not all be created at once)
"Shooting Star" gun's bullet animation plays slightly faster
Added a new TiledEditor level "shadingTest.tmx" to experiment with fragment shaders
// Note: still a work in progress, it'd take some time for me to be able to use excessive lighting in scenes
